# Obliviated Engine
Simple "game engine" written in C++ & DirectX 11

This is mainly a project for fun, and i have no expectations of this being used in an actual game outside of messing with it.
contributions are welcome and accepted. If a feature is something that isent harmfull i will probably accept the pull request.
